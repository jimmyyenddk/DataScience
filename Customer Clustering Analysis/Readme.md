This project is to create unsupervised machine learning model to create customer cluster.
The purpose is to group customers based on their gender, age, income, and the spending score.
To do this, we use KMeans from sklearn.

The outline of this project is:
- Data cleaning and EDA.
- Create model based on 5 clusters.
- Find the best number of cluster based on silhouette score.
- Evaluate this new model
