3,2021-09-04T09:00:13Z,Simple environmental considerations,"The service was great as was the produce. However, I was disappointed that I received a giant cardboard box approx 60 x40cm which contained 2 small items- a loaf of bread and crumpets.

One item was missing and it was invoiced. No prior notice about the product being not available until I had to chase up for it. One would think when an item is not available, you will not be able to order at the time and also not invoiced??? Complete mess. ",1

The order is delivered as scheduled, well packed in recyclable boxes. The tracking ability is great.
Another reliable aspect is the good quality and prompt refund if items are out of stock. such certainty is so reassuring just now.

27,2021-08-29T11:03:23Z,"Please unpack now, I need the blue bags back","I have always loved shopping at HF. But I found it is really annoying that the driver driver demand that ‘please unpack now, I need the blue bag’. 

Isn’t it meant to be a touch free delivery?
We are more than happy to return the bags, perhaps a ‘blue bag recycle’ program will be helpful? ",1

30,2021-08-29T00:13:51Z,Good but....,"In general I am happy with the service. The veg and fruit were good.
One of the one litre milk items was past used by on delivery.

38,2021-08-26T07:45:08Z,Very poor service!,"I ordered 3 meal packs. The delivery came with the grocery items but no fruit and veggies. 
I rang up and they said they would correct it. About 4 days later I received a delivery with 4 potatoes only! In the end we demanded a refund. I think HF has got lazy and rushing their orders. It's a shame as I've always really like HF products. 
Won't be ordering again as they cant get it right.

40,2021-08-26T03:37:34Z,Online grocery shopping - an evolving journey,"The first order I placed contained great produce and was delivered right on time. Great experience. I have since ordered twice more, each order about a week apart. The two subsequent orders arrived with significant delay and were also missing between 4 to 8 items I had been charged for. 

After I contacted the online desk and sent an email detailing the missing items it took 3 days to be delivered to me. The next order had 4 times missing and that was resolved by the Service Desk without any fuss.

I have since placed a further order and it went through without a hitch.

Sometimes teething pains are inevitable and we must all strive to be a little bit more patient with each other. This is a new world for us all and we must now navigate it together.

41,2021-08-26T01:51:38Z,Great service,"Pleased with my delivery.  Just one thing, I was not able to order dinner rolls, i think they come in a six pack from your bakery.  Hopefully I will be able to do it with my next order.

Rang twice to ask for these items to be delivered, offered a refund, but I explained I needed the capsicums for a particular recipe. I asked to speak to a supervisor or manager to arrange delivery of the missing items. Waited for a long time but none available. Told one would ring me, but still waiting. The remaining items in my order were in good condition. A disappointing first order and poor customer service so far. I am hoping that someone from company name can resolve this satisfactorily. ",1

Usually delivery is available next day although at the moment, due to lockdown it may take a couple of days to get a delivery spot.  Once delivery is booked, when it has left the shopper is notified with a very easy to follow tracking.  Food is of the highest quality, a good selection.  Highly recommended and I will definitely use regularly.",5

64,2021-08-21T01:33:55Z,Home Delivery Service a shambles & lack of email response,"Ordered some groceries from the online store for delivery. 
Delivery was scheduled for Wednesday and I received a text that morning advising due to unforeseen warehouse issues delivery would be rescheduled to Thursday. 
On Thursday morning I got an sms advising that due to unforeseen warehouse issues delivery would be between 6-9 am on Saturday. 
I emailed straight away advising company names I would like to cancel the order and a refund. 
They did not respond to the email. 
At 820am on Saturday a delivery arrived from them. 
There were only 4 of 10 items ordered actually delivered.  I received an email advising a credit for one of the missing items and no credit for the remaining 5 items missing. 
Very poor experience all round and I would not consider ever using their online store again. 
Communicating to your customers is an entry level requirement in providing the most basic customer support. ",2

66,2021-08-20T22:19:36Z,Your magnificent drivers,"I am always delighted with my company name delivery, and want to heap praise on the amazing young drivers, the men and women who bring me all this delightful food. I have had fantastic experiences with these drivers. A classic story was a young man from Africa, (I have made this country of origin up to protect his identity for reasons that will become obvious), who took time and trouble to graciously ensure I was ok, eg, unpacking the heavier items for me. He was respectful, engaging and efficient. I told him to please tell his Mum that this old, bedridden Australian woman, wanted her to know that she had done a fantastic job in bringing up an amazing young man. I laughed loudly at his response, ‘She has heard you, I am talking to her on the phone at the moment.’ Just one of many unforgettable experiences with your drivers.
Please recognise and affirm the amazing work these men and women are doing. Please pay them more.

A very good experience!",5
68,2021-08-20T21:05:39Z,A joke,Order was due to arrive on Wednesday. It’s finally *apparently* arriving on Saturday and they still have the nerve to charge $15 for delivery. Definitely going back to the majors as obviously company name can’t cope with the volume of orders during the pandemic. ,1
69,2021-08-20T13:17:53Z,Completely missing central ingredient of meal box,"The central and most expensive ingredient of our order of the beef rump caponata meal box (the actual beef rump) was completely missing from our online delivery.

73,2021-08-20T05:24:44Z,Keep away from this arrogant “family” business,"What is the point of ordering the Milkrun delivery slot 4am -7am if your order is consistently leaving the warehouse after 6:30am or like mine did today at 6:50am. They do not care. Once my delivery arrived at 10:30am. Customer service is useless, they open a 9am. I would have given them ZERO stars but couldn’t. I’m ordering from Lettuce from now on. They are useless and arrogant. Nothing “family” about them.",1

Not to mention the order was postponed due to some warehouse issues but still is not prepared well.

77,2021-08-20T02:00:25Z,My 3rd online delivery,"This was my third online delivery.
My first delivery I was very happy with packed well and veggy's and fruit looked good.
My 2nd delivery I got brussel sprouts instead of beans, and the wrong mushrooms which I excepted without complaint.
My third and final delivery packed terrible the tomatoes, bananas and mangos were at the bottom of the box with potatoes, onions carrots thrown on top, the bananas were badly bruised, mangos also if the tomatoes had been ripe they also would have been bruised. Delivery windows was between 18:00 and 21:00 didn't arrive until 22:20.
Disappointed and this will be my last order from company name I will not be rewarding them with even visiting there store. ",2
78,2021-08-19T21:01:08Z,It would be a 5 if I got my bagels!!!,Your service is great and would be 5 gold stars if I got my whole order. I’ve ordered from company name about 9 times now since lockdown in Sydney and I’ve only received the Brooklyn boy bagels once. Seems bakery items are low stock. ,4
79,2021-08-19T12:32:03Z,Far from ideal under the circumstances,"Ordered online during mandatory quarantine so really needed some groceries for the whole family. Order was filled except for a couple of items, which were subsequently refunded. Told delivery was on its way with an expected ETA 3 hrs which would have been within the requested delivery window. Instead delivered several hours later in the night. Driver left before we got to our items. We noticed several items were missing. Replied to their support email due to the late hour asking for the items or a refund and to let me know what they would do. Never received a reply to that email. I did get sent a notification of the delivery the next morning which even had photos which clearly showed we couldn't have possibly received our entire order. I felt good about supporting a local Australian business but have found this to be a terrible experience. I won't use them again and will (and have) recommend the same to others.

Update:
I've added a star. I did end up receiving a response eventually. It was very well written and a refund for the missing items was received. Support staff in general have a thankless task, so I can only imagine what pressure they are under. ",2
80,2021-08-19T12:24:12Z,You guys knocked it out if the park,As the covid cloud extends I found the veggies I was buying at bigger supermarkets weren’t great… but one order from company name and I’m a believer… my fresh veggies are so fresh and delicious and I’m really good condition… keeping me healthy and strong … I’m a fan of company name now and intend on continuing to buy and use in future as a result!,5
81,2021-08-19T08:27:49Z,Terrible customer service and unreliable delivery,I placed an order on Monday for delivery on Wednesday.  I was advised by email on Wednesday afternoon after delivery window had commenced that they had warehouse error and I would now receive my order on Thursday afternoon.  My order was still showing unfulfilled by Thursday afternoon so I phoned customer service again and after waiting for 20 minutes was advised warehouse error again and my order was now rescheduled for delivery on Saturday.  No apology or communication in advance to changing my delivery date a second time.  I cancelled the order as they gave me no confidence I would receive order on Saturday.  It’s a shame as they have good products but very poor customer service and logistics and no complaints handling procedures. Not worth the stress of not knowing when you may get your order and having to wait 2 to 4 business days for a refund for an order you didn’t receive.,1
82,2021-08-19T06:23:04Z,Delivery service cancelled with no notice until was due to turn up,"Ordered on a Monday for Wednesday delivery.

1. Bananas delivered were bruised black and soft on inside, I had to throw out one of them (same day delivered);
2. Replacement item was not indicated on invoice but I also requested not to replace item;
3. No system for delivery driver to take back the company name card board vegetable box for recycling.",3

90,2021-08-16T10:31:34Z,Excellent produce and service,I have always loved shopping at company name stores - they have a great range of continental grocery items and excellent quality produce. I was a little concerned about ordering fresh produce online - I like to select my produce - but the lockdown has led me to embrace the possibility and I'm delighted.,5
91,2021-08-16T08:17:14Z,"Great quality, brilliant delivery service",The food quality from company names is great.  I ordered a “picnic box” fir my husbands birthday and all the food was perfect.

97,2021-08-15T06:08:05Z,Woolworths can't hold a candle to company name for freshness of Vegies and Fruit,"It is such a pleasure to order fresh vegies and fruit and find out when they arrive that they are indeed fresh. I used to shop at the local Woolworths store but after trying their online shop for fresh fruit and vegies I have come to the conclusion that Woolworths is using Robots to pack their online orders as the fruit and vegies are not fresh when they arrive. With the lockdown in Sydney, I was getting desperate until I discovered company name online shopping. I have had 2 online deliveries over the course of  two weeks and what a pleasant surprise it was to find that the fruit and vegies from company name is indeed fresh ! ",5
98,2021-08-15T04:39:49Z,Terrible company to deal with and service is unacceptable,"Bought a birthday dinner for my daughter who i have not seen for nearly a year since lockdown and the order did not arrive.  No one rang to let me know - only found out when i rang up to find out why it was so late.  No apology as to why no one told us and not able to get it to us even the next day - it arrived 2 days later (completely useless).  Asked to speak to the Operations Manager (Warren) who i was assured would ring me back.  Never did.  So upsetting for us especially since we were trying to give her a special night and when you have every other company we used that night turn up with the birthday gifts, wine etc but no food.  Will never use company name again.  ",1

HF contacted via txt to give up dates and advised on the actual time of delivery.

119,2021-08-12T06:31:30Z,Substitutions made without permission,"Your products are generally great, and your deliveries are on-time! However there are usually substitutions made in my online orders, presumably where a product I requested is unavailable. For example, this morning instead of 2x Chicken Biryani and 1x Chicken Tikka, I received 3x Coconut and Lentil curry. This would be fair enough, except that I explicitly tick the box requesting NO substitutions when a product is not available! Hence, sadly, I can only give you 3 stars out of 5 :-(.",3
120,2021-08-12T02:07:22Z,Very good service,"Very efficient ordering system, especially up-front advice re delivery time/date.  Reliable and good quality and variety of produce.  They provide cooler bag which you return next order.",5

123,2021-08-11T13:43:18Z,Good variety of food but the prices are often wrong,"I regularly buy food in company name (Cook’s Hill, Newcastle) and very happy with variety and freshness. But when I check my receipt- there are often wrong prices : they mix it up at the register and sell fruits/vegetables for higher price than they are (not as marked at the price on boxes). Food on specials also usually is for full price in the receipt. 
If you buy the whole trolley of products - it’s quite hard to remember and check every item after paying…
When I noticed another mistake on my receipt- the lady at the register was talking very rude with me and never said sorry…
If someone doesn’t pay for purchase - the shop assistant would call the police , so what the customers should do if the shop steals money from their pockets without any shame?..
I wish the shop assistants at the register be more polite and careful with prices.
Thank you ",4
124,2021-08-11T09:47:59Z,"Great quality organic food, much better than doorstep organics.","I used to shop at (doorstep organics) but i have had many issues with them so i found these guys are much better, cheaper and the packaging is very individualised, well and neatly placed. Also everything seemed to be picked nicely, although somethings were small for the price like the Broccoli but overall was happy. The only thing that doorstep does better is they offer free shipping for $100+ where its a high $220 here. 
Organic food is expensive enough. Thank you.",5

Second time using online shop - delivered outside delivery window.,"I like products from company name but ordering online is hit and miss. I’ve only used it twice (online ordering), the first time - there were items that were not delivered, which I had to call in order to get a refund. 
The second time I ordered they delivered my items after the delivery window period (2PM - 10PM) at midnight.
For someone who has only used this service twice, it is highly disappointing and off putting. I have only ordered for delivery in Sydney region, this may be different in regional areas.",1

183,2021-08-01T05:26:36Z,Better Than Expected,"This was the first time we have ordered from company names. Website clunky but once mastered easy to use, items were slightly more expensive than our usual supermarket, however this is more than made up as the quality and freshness especially of the fruit and vegetables. Will definitely use company names for shopping going forward.",4
184,2021-07-31T10:31:28Z,Not Perfect But Good Enough!,"I love my shopping experience with company name in store but nor so sure with this 1st time online shopping.

I always put my trust into the food quality of company name. The standard of freshness maintains even for those imperfect fruits and veggies. So the food boxes I chose were both ""Imperfect Pick"". But when I opened mine, I spotted some pears were so ""imperfect"" that part of their peels are broken and rotten, where bacteria go in. I understand imperfect fruits aren't perfect but these are not healthy to be eaten. Fortunately, the rest of the box are fine. Hope they could be returned and exchanged for eatable pears. Apart from this, the rest is good, the shipping, the service. I still would shop at the shop.",4
185,2021-07-31T07:58:30Z,Best ever online shopping experience,"I tried company name online delivery service after the disastrous experience with Coles Online. company name's service is like experience a First Class flight after flying cattle class. If I could give 100 stars out of 5, I would. I am amazed at the customer service of the order (from confirmation emails to SMS with a link to track the delivery 15 mins before the selected delivery window); the excellent quality of the fruits and veggies and how well the dried and cold goods are packed. I will continue to order from company name going forward. Really appreciate the excellent service. Thank you.",5

There is one product however we have been disappointed now a few times and that's the packaged mushrooms. There is not ""date of packaged"" nor ""use by date"". With a packaged product it is very hard to tell the freshness of a product. We strongly suggest to give that information on packaged fresh produce.
Looking forward to your suggestions.

205,2021-07-27T03:43:49Z,Better than shopping at the main 2 supermarkets,"The value boxes are the best! 
Whenever I have ordered fresh produce from the big 2 supermarkets the produce was ALWAYS bruised, marked and wilted. 
But with company name I have not had a bad piece of produce yet and I have been ordering from them for the last 12 months!!!",5
206,2021-07-27T02:10:05Z,Very poor first dleivery,"Ordered in their online store first time with 10 items, 6 of which are missing when delivered. The worst online grocery shopping experience I ever had in my life. We need those items for our kid, when asked if they can make up the delivery tomorrow which they don’t even want to make the slightest effort to help out, so asked for a refund. Now we are left with no milk/yoghurt for the night and I have to do an early shopping run tomorrow during the lockdown. Thanks company name for ruining our plans. Never again.",1

2. The substituted lamb item wasn't what I would have ordered, but looks so good I'm happy to keep it.
3. I was given a larger piece of pork than I'd ordered yet not charged the extra $12 for it.
4. Love the app that shows exactly where the driver is.

One question - do subscribers to your emails get 5% off fruit and veggies on online orders?  If so, we don't appear to have received it on this order.

Will definitely be ordering again from HFM.  Thank you!",5

213,2021-07-26T01:09:46Z,Almost perfect,Your pictures online shopping. A suggestion so others don't make the same mistake I and 2 others have made. I wanted 6 single carrots. I received 6 KG of carrots. This was because the picture of the carrots represented that  they were loose- and not in a plastic bag. Yes I needed to have checked price - my bad. Other acquaintances of mine thought they were buying 12 bananas - got 12 KG and and 6 cucumbers received 6 KG!! Fortunately I can give the carrots away. But it was a very expensive mistake on my part. Other than that. LOVE company name produce. ,4
