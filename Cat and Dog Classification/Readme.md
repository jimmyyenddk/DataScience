This project is to create deep learning model to classify cat and dog images.
The dataset is provided from Microsoft website here:

To do this, we use TensorFlow CNN for classification.

The outline of this project is:
- Cleaning of some images.
- See some sample images.
- Try Image Data Generator for preview.
- Create CNN model for training.
- Evaluate this model
- Testing of images
